Report for Exercise 2:

Question 1:
The use of static methods and variables in game applications can significantly impact the design and functionality of the codebase. The principal benefit of static variables or methods is that they belong to the class rather than any instance of the class. This can be advantageous in game programming for managing resources that do not change across different instances of a game, such as constants or utility methods. They provide efficient access and can lead to reduced memory consumption as there is one copy per class.

However, the drawbacks include reduced flexibility and the potential for tight coupling. Static variables persist for the lifetime of the application, and thus any change to their values affects every part of the application accessing them. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, especially with multi-level game states, as each level could have different needs. Furthermore, static methods cannot be overridden, which could restrain polymorphism.

Question 2:
In player data management, static variables or methods should be used for global settings or utilities that are shared across all player instances. For example, a static method to calculate a player's level progression based on a global experience points (XP) table:

```java
public class PlayerUtils {

    // Static utility method for all players
    public static int calculateLevel(int xp, int[] xpTable) {
        int level = 0;
        while (level < xpTable.length && xp >= xpTable[level]) {
            level++;
        }
        return level;
    }
}
```

Additionally, global configuration settings or constants, such as maximum allowed players or default avatars, can be stored as static:

```java
public class GameSettings {
    public static final int MAX_PLAYERS = 10;
    public static final String DEFAULT_AVATAR = "DefaultAvatar.png";

    // Other global settings...
}
```
*/

// Arrays.java

/**
* A simple class modeling arrays
* Provides utility methods for array manipulation
*/
public class Arrays {

    /**
    * Counts the average value of elements in an integer array
    * @param array input array of integers
    * @return the average of element integer sum
    */
    public static int average(int[] array) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            sum += array[i];
        }
        return sum / array.length;
    }
}

// SetTheory.java

import java.util.ArrayList;

/**
* A class demonstrating simple set operations using array lists
*/
public class SetTheory {

    // The maximum threshold for set generation
    private static final int MAX = 100;

    /**
    * Generates an ArrayList between min and max
    * @param min lower bound, inclusive
    * @param max upper bound, non-inclusive
    * @return an ArrayList with all integers in [min, max - 1]
    */
    public static ArrayList<Integer> generateSet(int min, int max) {
        ArrayList<Integer> set = new ArrayList<>();
        if (min >= max) {
            // return empty list
            return set;
        } else {
            // Ternary operator to see if max > 100
            for (int i = Math.max(min, 0); i < Math.min(max, MAX); i++) {
                set.add(i);
            }
            return set;
        }
    }

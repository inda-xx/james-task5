Below is a complete solution for Exercise 3. The solution involves creating a `GameWorld` class that uses a static two-dimensional array to represent a 10x10 grid. It includes methods to initialize the grid and place the player at a specified starting position. The player is represented by a specific value in the grid (e.g., 1), while other empty spaces are initialized to 0. Each method is well-documented with comments.

```java
public class GameWorld {
    // Define the grid size
    private static final int GRID_SIZE = 10;
    
    // A static 10x10 grid represented by a two-dimensional array
    private static final int[][] grid = new int[GRID_SIZE][GRID_SIZE];
    
    // Constant to represent an empty space in the grid
    private static final int EMPTY = 0;
    
    // Constant to represent the player in the grid
    private static final int PLAYER = 1;
    
    /**
     * Initializes the grid by setting all cells to EMPTY
     */
    public static void initializeGrid() {
        for (int i = 0; i < GRID_SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < GRID_SIZE; j++) {
                grid[i][j] = EMPTY;
            }
        }
    }
    
    /**
     * Places the player at specified coordinates (x, y) in the grid.
     *
     * @param x The x-coordinate to place the player at.
     * @param y The y-coordinate to place the player at.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the coordinates are out of bounds.
     */
    public static void placePlayer(int x, int y) {
        if (x < 0 || x >= GRID_SIZE || y < 0 || y >= GRID_SIZE) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Coordinates are out of bounds");
        }
        // First, ensure that the previous player position is cleared
        // This is optional based on game logic - only if the player moves
        for (int i = 0; i < GRID_SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < GRID_SIZE; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == PLAYER) {
                    grid[i][j] = EMPTY; // Clear the previous position of the player
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Place the player at the specified position
        grid[x][y] = PLAYER;
    }
    
    /**
     * Prints the grid to the console for visualization.
     */
    public static void printGrid() {
        for (int i = 0; i < GRID_SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < GRID_SIZE; j++) {
                System.out.print(grid[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }

    // Main method for demonstrating functionality
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        initializeGrid(); // Initialize the grid
        placePlayer(4, 5); // Place the player at position (4, 5)
        
        // Print the initial grid state
        System.out.println("Initial Game World:");
        printGrid();

        // Move player to a new position
        placePlayer(7, 8);
        
        // Print the grid state after moving the player
        System.out.println("\nAfter moving player:");
        printGrid();
    }
}
```

### Key Features of This Solution:
- **Initialization**: The `initializeGrid` method sets every cell in the grid to `0`, indicating empty spaces.
- **Player Placement**: The `placePlayer` method inserts the player at a specified position. It also clears any previous player position, which simulates moving.
- **Bounds Checking**: The `placePlayer` method checks to ensure that the provided coordinates are within the grid bounds, throwing an exception if they aren't.
- **Visualization**: The `printGrid` method provides a simple way to see the state of the grid at various points, which is helpful for testing and debugging.
- **Main Method**: Demonstrates how to use the class by initializing the grid, placing a player, and printing the grid to the console.

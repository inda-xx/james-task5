To tackle this exercise, we'll implement a class `GameWorld` that includes a `movePlayer` method. This method will handle player movement based on input directions such as "up", "down", "left", and "right". Additionally, we'll incorporate logic to ensure the player does not move out of bounds. We'll also provide a straightforward mechanism to detect collisions with enemies within the game world.

Here's the complete solution:

```java
public class GameWorld {

    // Assuming a 2D grid for the game world, with these dimensions
    private static final int WORLD_WIDTH = 10;
    private static final int WORLD_HEIGHT = 10;
    
    // Player's current position
    private int playerX = 5;
    private int playerY = 5;
    
    // An example: Define enemy positions (for simplicity, assume fixed positions)
    private int[][] enemies = {
        {2, 3},
        {7, 8},
        {5, 5}  // Starting at the same place as player for demonstration purposes
    };

    // Method to move the player in the specified direction
    public boolean movePlayer(String direction) {
        int newX = playerX;
        int newY = playerY;
        
        // Determine the new position based on the direction
        switch (direction.toLowerCase()) {
            case "up":
                newY -= 1;
                break;
            case "down":
                newY += 1;
                break;
            case "left":
                newX -= 1;
                break;
            case "right":
                newX += 1;
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid direction: " + direction);
                return false;
        }
        
        // Check if the new position is within bounds
        if (newX < 0 || newX >= WORLD_WIDTH || newY < 0 || newY >= WORLD_HEIGHT) {
            System.out.println("Movement out of bounds!");
            return false;
        }

        // Update player's position
        playerX = newX;
        playerY = newY;
        
        // Check for collision with enemies
        if (checkCollisionWithEnemies()) {
            System.out.println("Collision with enemy detected at: (" + playerX + ", " + playerY + ")");
            // Typically handle collision, such as losing health, etc.
            return true;
        }

        System.out.println("Player moved to: (" + playerX + ", " + playerY + ")");
        return true;
    }

    // Method to check if the player has collided with an enemy
    private boolean checkCollisionWithEnemies() {
        for (int[] enemy : enemies) {
            if (playerX == enemy[0] && playerY == enemy[1]) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GameWorld gameWorld = new GameWorld();
        
        // Example movements
        gameWorld.movePlayer("up");
        gameWorld.movePlayer("left");
        gameWorld.movePlayer("down");
        gameWorld.movePlayer("right");
        gameWorld.movePlayer("right");  // This would eventually cause a collision if enemies are on the way
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **GameWorld Class**: 
   - Contains the game world's dimensions, the player's start position, and an example set of enemy positions.

2. **movePlayer Method**:
   - Takes a direction as input and calculates the new potential position.
   - Checks whether this new position is within the defined world bounds.
   - Adjusts the player's current position if within bounds.
   - Calls `checkCollisionWithEnemies` to check if the player has collided with any enemies.
   
3. **checkCollisionWithEnemies Method**:
   - Iterates through enemy positions to determine if the player's new position coincides with any.
   
4. **Main Method**:
   - Performs a few sample movements showing the player moving and potentially colliding with enemies.

By using this setup, the player can be moved within the bounds of the world grid, and interactions with enemy positions can trigger a game-specific response (as demonstrated by the collision detection output).

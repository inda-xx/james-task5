# üéÆ Build Your First Game: Learning through Development

Welcome to the exciting world of game development! This task will help you understand fundamental programming concepts while building a simple 2D game application. Follow along with the exercises to implement player movement, a dynamic scoring system, and interactions with enemies.

## üèÅ Learning Objectives

- Utilize `Arrays` for data storage and manipulation.
- Understand the `static` keyword in the context of game mechanics.
- Employ `ArrayLists` to manage dynamic elements.
- Combine loops and collections to enhance game functionality.

## üìã Task Overview

- **Exercise 1:** Set up the player grid.
- **Exercise 2:** Implement player controls.
- **Exercise 3:** Develop a scoring system.
- **Exercise 4:** Set up enemy entities.
- **Exercise 5:** Implement enemy movement.
- **Exercise 6:** Handle player-enemy interactions.
- **Exercise 7:** Dynamic scoring with power-ups.
- **Exercise 8:** Combine collections for advanced gameplay.

## üöÄ Exercises

### Exercise 1: Setting Up the Player Grid
**Goal:** Utilize `Arrays` to create a 2D grid for the player‚Äôs position.

1. Create a new file called `GameGrid.java`.
2. Implement a `static` method `initializeGrid` that accepts grid dimensions and returns a 2D `int` array.
3. Each cell in the array should represent a part of the game grid, with the player starting at position `(0,0)`.

### Exercise 2: Implement Player Controls
**Goal:** Simulate player movement using array indices.

1. In `GameGrid.java`, create a method `movePlayer` that takes initial coordinates and a direction (`"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"`, `"right"`).
2. Ensure the method updates the player‚Äôs position on the grid appropriately and prints the new position to the console.

### Exercise 3: Develop a Scoring System
**Goal:** Implement `static` variables to maintain a persistent game score.

1. Add a `static` variable `score` to `GameGrid.java`.
2. Create a method `updateScore` that accepts points to add when the player performs specific actions.

### Exercise 4: Setting Up Enemy Entities
**Goal:** Use `ArrayLists` to manage multiple enemies on the grid.

1. In a new file `EnemyManager.java`, declare an `ArrayList` to store enemy coordinates.
2. Implement `addEnemy` and `removeEnemy` methods that manipulate the list.

### Exercise 5: Implement Enemy Movement
**Goal:** Simulate enemy movement using loops.

1. Within `EnemyManager.java`, write a method `moveEnemies` that iterates over the list and adjusts the position of each enemy.
2. Randomize enemy movement slightly by altering their coordinates in each iteration.

### Exercise 6: Handle Player-Enemy Interactions
**Goal:** Detect and handle collisions between the player and enemies.

1. In `GameGrid.java`, implement a collision detection method `checkPlayerCollision`.
2. If a collision is detected with any enemy, invoke a game over sequence and print a message.

### Exercise 7: Dynamic Scoring with Power-Ups
**Goal:** Use dynamic arrays to manage game elements like power-ups.

1. Enhance the scoring system by introducing power-ups placed randomly on the grid.
2. Use an `ArrayList` to track these power-ups and adjust scoring when the player collects them.

### Exercise 8: Combine Collections for Advanced Gameplay
**Goal:** Integrate player and enemy systems using collections for a seamless game loop.

1. Create a main loop in a new file `GameLoop.java` that continuously updates the game state: player movements, enemy movements, score updating, and collision checking.
2. Use the previously defined methods to manage the game flow efficiently.

**üéÆ Game Development Task: Simple Adventure Game**

Welcome to your next coding adventure! In this task, you'll design and implement a simple adventure game that integrates key programming concepts. Your game will feature player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. Throughout the exercises, you'll practice using arrays and array lists, understand the `static` keyword, and combine loops with collections. The challenge will escalate with each exercise, encouraging you to build on previous knowledge and skills.

### üìö Exercise 1: Exploring Arrays

**Objective:** Deepen your theoretical understanding of arrays and their use cases.

**Instructions:**  
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using arrays versus ArrayLists in Java, particularly in terms of memory management and performance.
- Explain the situations where you would prefer to use arrays over ArrayLists and vice versa. Consider the context of developing a game where quick access to game entities like players and enemies is crucial.
  
**Response Format:** Write a short essay (200-300 words) supporting your explanation with examples relevant to game development.

### üìö Exercise 2: Understanding the Static Keyword

**Objective:** Comprehend the purpose and application of the `static` keyword in Java.

**Instructions:**  
- Explain the concept of the `static` keyword in Java. How does it affect variables, methods, and blocks within a class?
- Describe a scenario in a game application where using `static` might be necessary. Consider aspects like global game settings or a shared score tracker.

**Response Format:** Provide a detailed explanation with at least one example scenario (150-200 words).

### üöÄ Exercise 3: Implementing Player Movement with Arrays

**Objective:** Apply knowledge of arrays to manage and manipulate game player data.

**Task:** Implement a simple `Player` class with the following properties: `name`, `position(x, y)`, `score`. Use an array to store the player's position.

**Instructions:**  
- Write a method `movePlayer(int dx, int dy)` in the `Player` class that updates the player‚Äôs position based on input deltas, `dx` and `dy`.
- Ensure the player‚Äôs new position is printed each time it is moved.
- Demonstrate this functionality in a `main` method by moving the player to several different coordinates.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Player {
    private String name;
    private int[] position = new int[2];
    private int score;

    public Player(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.position[0] = 0;
        this.position[1] = 0;
        this.score = 0;
    }

    public void movePlayer(int dx, int dy) {
        // Update position
        // Print new position
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a player and test movement
    }
}
```

### üöÄ Exercise 4: Building a Dynamic Scoring System with ArrayLists

**Objective:** Utilize ArrayLists to manage a dynamic collection of player scores over time.

**Task:** Implement a scoring system where each score is stored in an ArrayList. Allow scores to be added dynamically.

**Instructions:**  
- Create a method `addScore(int score)` in the `Player` class that adds the score to an ArrayList.
- Implement `calculateAverageScore()` to evaluate the average score of all scores stored in the ArrayList.
- Demonstrate this feature by adding several scores and printing the average.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Player {
    private ArrayList<Integer> scores = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addScore(int score) {
        // Add score to ArrayList
    }
    
    public double calculateAverageScore() {
        // Calculate and return average score
    }
}
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Exercise 5: Enemy Interactions - Detecting Proximity

**Objective:** Combine loops and collections to detect interactions between players and enemies.

**Task:** Write a program that manages multiple enemy positions and checks for proximity to the player.

**Instructions:**  
- Use an ArrayList to store enemy positions, where each position is stored as an integer array `[x, y]`.
- Write a method `checkProximity(int range)` that loops through the enemy list and prints out enemies within the specified range from the player.
- Demonstrate the functionality by adding enemies and checking proximity in various scenarios.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Game {
    private ArrayList<int[]> enemies = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public void addEnemy(int x, int y) {
        // Add enemy position
    }
    
    public void checkProximity(int range, Player player) {
        // Check and print enemies within range
    }
}
```

### üß© Exercise 6: Bringing It All Together - The Complete Game Loop

**Objective:** Integrate all features into a functioning game loop that simulates player and enemy actions.

**Task:** Create a game loop that allows player movement and interacts with enemies, updating scores based on interactions.

**Instructions:**  
- Use previously defined classes and methods to implement a game turn where the player can move and interact with enemies.
- Implement logic for scoring when the player successfully avoids or engages enemies.
- Continuously print the player‚Äôs score and position after each turn.
- Exit the loop when a specific condition is met, like a score threshold or player decision.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Game {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize player and enemies
        // Game loop: move player, check interactions, update score
    }
}
```

**Outcome:** By the end of this combined exercise, you will have created a simple yet functional game showcasing player movement, score management, and enemy interactions.

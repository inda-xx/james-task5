**üéÆ Simple Game Development Task**

Welcome to the Simple Game Development Task! In this project, you'll create a minimalistic game application that features player movement, a scoring system, and interactions with enemies. Throughout these exercises, you'll deepen your understanding of programming concepts including arrays, the `static` keyword, `ArrayLists`, and the combination of loops and collections. This will be an exciting journey from conceptual understanding to tangible implementation and game logic enhancement.

### üöÄ Exercise 1: Theoretical Foundations with Arrays

**Objective:** Gain a solid theoretical understanding of how arrays work in Java, along with their strengths and limitations.

**Task:** Answer the following questions:

1. **What is an Array?** Provide a detailed explanation of arrays, including how they are structured in memory, their fixed size nature, and what advantages they offer over other data structures.
   
2. **Array Limitations:** Discuss the limitations of arrays with respect to dynamic storage requirements. Why might these limitations lead programmers to consider other data structures like `ArrayList`?

**Expected Outcome:** Clear, thoughtful responses that demonstrate a deep understanding of arrays.

### üîç Exercise 2: Understanding Static and Its Applications

**Objective:** Develop a theoretical understanding of the `static` keyword in Java and where it might be useful in game development.

**Task:** Explain the following:

1. **Static Fields and Methods:** Define what a static field and a static method are in Java and their lifecycle during program execution.
   
2. **Use Cases in Gaming:** Describe a scenario in game development where using static fields or methods would be beneficial. Consider aspects such as global game states or utility functions.

**Expected Outcome:** Well-reasoned explanations and examples of practical use cases.

### üé® Exercise 3: Implementing Player Movement with Arrays

**Objective:** Apply your understanding of arrays to manage player movement in a 2D grid-based game world.

**Task:** Implement a simple class that manages the player‚Äôs position on a game board.

1. Create a class `GameBoard` where:
   - The board is represented by a 2D array of integers.
   - The player's position is marked by a specific integer value.

2. Implement methods:
   ```java
   public class GameBoard {
       private final int[][] board;
       private int[] playerPosition = {0, 0}; // Start at top-left corner

       public GameBoard(int rows, int cols) {
           board = new int[rows][cols];
           board[playerPosition[0]][playerPosition[1]] = 1; // Mark player position
       }

       public void movePlayer(int newRow, int newCol) {
           board[playerPosition[0]][playerPosition[1]] = 0; // Clear old position
           playerPosition[0] = newRow;
           playerPosition[1] = newCol;
           board[newRow][newCol] = 1; // Mark new position
       }
   }
   ```

**Expected Outcome:** A simple mechanism to update the player's position.

### üèπ Exercise 4: Basic Scoring System with Static Variables

**Objective:** Use static variables to manage and update the player's score globally.

**Task:**

1. Within the `GameBoard` class, implement a static field to track the score.
   
2. Create a method `public static int getScore()` to retrieve the score and `public static void increaseScore(int points)` to update it:
   ```java
   public static class GameBoard {
       private static int score = 0;
       
       public static void increaseScore(int points) {
           score += points;
       }

       public static int getScore() {
           return score;
       }
   }
   ```
   
3. Demonstrate these methods by modifying player interactions (e.g., gaining points on certain movements).

**Expected Outcome:** Functionality to manage the game's scoring system effectively.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Exercise 5: Managing Enemy Interactions with ArrayLists

**Objective:** Utilize `ArrayLists` to dynamically manage a list of enemy positions, showcasing the benefit over fixed arrays.

**Task:**

1. Implement an `EnemyManager` class that maintains enemy positions:
   ```java
   public class EnemyManager {
       private ArrayList<int[]> enemies = new ArrayList<>();

       public void addEnemy(int row, int col) {
           enemies.add(new int[] {row, col});
       }

       public void moveEnemies() {
           for (int[] enemy : enemies) {
               enemy[0] += 1; // Example logic: move down on the board
           }
       }

       public ArrayList<int[]> getEnemies() {
           return enemies;
       }
   }
   ```

2. Demonstrate adding, moving, and retrieving enemies.

**Expected Outcome:** Successfully manage multiple enemies and their movements.

### üß© Exercise 6: Integrating All Elements with Game Logic

**Objective:** Develop a small, functioning game loop that integrates player movement, scoring, and enemy interactions.

**Task:**

1. In a `Game` class, integrate the `GameBoard`, `EnemyManager`, and scoring system:
   ```java
   public class Game {
       private GameBoard gameBoard;
       private EnemyManager enemyManager;
       
       public Game(int rows, int cols) {
           gameBoard = new GameBoard(rows, cols);
           enemyManager = new EnemyManager();
       }

       public void gameLoop() {
           // Example of a simple loop to move players and enemies
       }
   }
   ```
2. Implement a simple loop mechanism to simulate player and enemy movements. Update the score based on specific actions (e.g., escaping enemies).

3. Add the logic to detect collisions or interactions with either boundaries or enemies, affecting the score and game state.

**Expected Outcome:** A simple playable game that demonstrates understanding of arrays, `ArrayList`, loops, and static contexts.

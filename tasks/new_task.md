## üïπÔ∏è Simple Game Application: Arrays and Collections Adventure

Welcome to your new programming challenge! In this task, you'll create a simple console-based game application that consists of player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. This task will help you get hands-on experience with fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, the `static` keyword, and `ArrayLists`.

### Learning Goals
- Working with `Arrays`
- Understanding the `static` keyword
- Working with `ArrayLists`
- Combining loops and collections

### üöÄ Exercise 1: Theoretical Foundations - Arrays and `static`

**Objective**: Deepen your understanding of arrays and the `static` keyword.

**Task**:
1. **Conceptual Understanding**: Explain in your own words what an array is, and how it can be used for storing multiple elements of the same type. Discuss the limitations of arrays as well.
   
2. **`static` Keyword Exploration**: Explain what the `static` keyword does in Java. Provide examples of when and why you might use it in the context of a game application.

### üí° Exercise 2: Theoretical Foundations - ArrayLists

**Objective**: Understand the dynamic nature of `ArrayLists`.

**Task**:
1. **Comparison**: Compare and contrast arrays and `ArrayLists`. Under which circumstances would you prefer one over the other in a game development context?
   
2. **Lifecycle of an `ArrayList`**: Explain how you can add, remove, and access elements in an `ArrayList`. Provide pseudocode for typical operations that modify the state of an `ArrayList`.

### üèóÔ∏è Exercise 3: Player Movement System

**Objective**: Implement basic player movement using arrays and static methods.

**Task**:
1. Define a `static` array that represents your game grid (e.g., a 5x5 grid). Initialize your player at a starting position (e.g., top-left corner).
   
2. Create a `static` method `movePlayer` that takes the player's current position, a direction ("up", "down", "left", "right"), and updates the player's position in the grid.

```java
public static void movePlayer(int[] playerPosition, String direction, int[][] grid) {
    // Implement logic to update player's position based on the direction
}
```

3. Write code to test `movePlayer`, ensuring it handles boundaries correctly.

### üéØ Exercise 4: Basic Scoring System

**Objective**: Implement a simple scoring system using collections.

**Task**:
1. Use an `ArrayList` to keep track of collectible items on the grid. Each item increases the player's score upon collection.
   
2. Implement a method `collectItem` that updates the `ArrayList` of items based on the player's position.

```java
public static int collectItem(int[] playerPosition, ArrayList<int[]> items) {
    // Remove item from the list if player's position matches an item's position
    // Return score increment
}
```

3. Write a test to ensure items are properly collected and the score is updated.

### ü§ñ Exercise 5: Enemy Interactions

**Objective**: Introduce enemy movement and interactions using loops and collections.

**Task**:
1. Define an `ArrayList` to represent enemy positions on the grid. Implement a method `moveEnemies` that randomly changes enemy positions each turn.

```java
public static void moveEnemies(ArrayList<int[]> enemyPositions, int[][] grid) {
    // Implement enemy movement logic
}
```

2. Implement a method `checkCollisions` to determine if the player collides with any enemies, and print a message if a collision occurs.

```java
public static boolean checkCollisions(int[] playerPosition, ArrayList<int[]> enemyPositions) {
    // Return true if player's position matches any enemy's position
}
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Exercise 6: Completing the Game Loop

**Objective**: Combine all components into a functioning game loop.

**Task**:
1. In your `main` method, set up a loop that continuously allows the player to move, checks for item collections and enemy collisions, and updates the score.
   
2. Ensure that your game loop continues as long as the player does not collide with an enemy.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Initialize the grid, player, items, and enemies
    // Implement game loop using previous methods
}
```

3. Add a scoring display and game-over message when a collision with an enemy occurs.

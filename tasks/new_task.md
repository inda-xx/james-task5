## ðŸŽ® Simple Game Application: Programming Task

Welcome to the exciting journey of creating a simple game application! In this task, you'll implement a basic game that includes player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. Throughout this task, you will leverage key programming concepts such as arrays, the `static` keyword, and `ArrayLists`. You will also combine loops and collections to bring your game to life. This task is designed to be progressive, starting with theoretical understanding and moving to practical implementation.

### ðŸ“š Exercise 1: Understanding Arrays and The `static` Keyword

**Objective:** Deepen your theoretical understanding of arrays and the `static` keyword.

#### Questions:

1. **Arrays**: 
   - Explain the key differences between arrays and `ArrayLists`. What are some scenarios where arrays are preferable over `ArrayLists`?
   - Describe how memory is managed for arrays in Java. How does this differ from memory management for `ArrayLists`?

2. **The `static` Keyword**: 
   - Explain what the `static` keyword does in Java. Provide an example of a situation where using `static` is beneficial.
   - Discuss potential drawbacks or limitations of using `static` in a class.

### ðŸ“š Exercise 2: Concepts of Player Movement and Scoring System

**Objective:** Theoretical exploration of implementing player movement and scoring mechanisms.

#### Questions:

1. **Player Movement**:
   - Suppose you are implementing a player movement using a 2D grid. How would you utilize arrays to represent the grid and manage player coordinates?
   - Explain the algorithm you would use to detect if a player has moved out of the grid bounds.

2. **Scoring System**:
   - Discuss possible data structures to track and update a player's score as they progress through the game.
   - How would you implement a high-score leaderboard using `ArrayLists`? Describe the algorithm in detail.

### ðŸ’» Exercise 3: Implementing Player and Enemy Structures

**Objective:** Create and manage player and enemy structures using arrays and `ArrayLists`.

#### Task:

1. **Player Class with Static Method**:
   - Implement a `Player` class. Use the `static` keyword to declare and manage the player's `highScore` as a class variable.
   - Add methods to move the player on a 10x10 grid. Use an array to manage player's current position `(x, y)`.

2. **Enemy Class Using `ArrayLists`**:
   - Implement an `Enemy` class with attributes like `position` and `energyLevel`.
   - Use an `ArrayList` to manage multiple enemy instances within the game.
   - Write a static method to respawn all enemies at random positions on the grid.

### ðŸ’» Exercise 4: Combining Loops and Collections for Game Interaction

**Objective:** Use loops and collections for dynamic game interactions involving scoring and collision.

#### Task:

1. **Dynamic Scoring System**:
   - Implement a scoring system that increases the player's score each time they move.
   - Use a `static` method to reset the score when the game restarts.

2. **Player-Enemy Collision**:
   - Write a method that checks for collisions between the player and enemies using nested loops and `ArrayLists`.
   - Implement logic such that a collision results in randomly respawning the enemy and deducting points from the player's score.

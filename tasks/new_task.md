# üéÆ Game Development Task: Simple Adventure Game

Welcome to this exciting task where you will apply fundamental programming concepts to create a simple adventure game! Throughout this task, you'll tackle various challenges focusing on player movement, scoring systems, and enemy interactions. This task will help you understand arrays, the `static` keyword, ArrayLists, loops, and collections. 

## üåü Learning Goals

1. **Working with Arrays**
2. **Understanding the `static` keyword**
3. **Working with ArrayLists**
4. **Combining loops and collections**

**Structure**

- **Exercises 1 & 2**: Theoretical understanding.
- **Exercises 3 & 4**: Practical coding integration.
- **Exercises 5 & 6**: Comprehensive development tasks.

Let's dive into the exercises!

## üß† Exercise 1: Arrays and Their Applications

**Objective:** Deepen your understanding of `Arrays` in Java.

**Description:** Explain the following:

- How do arrays store multiple elements? Discuss their usefulness in game development, specifically in managing game states like positions and game grids.
  
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of using arrays in a game development context? Consider scenarios like fixed level designs versus dynamic content creation.

**Expected Length:** 150-200 words for each explanation.

*Tip: Think about how arrays can store positions of players and enemies, and what challenges arise when levels change.*

## üöÄ Exercise 2: The Power of the `static` Keyword

**Objective:** Understand the `static` keyword and its applications.

**Description:** Discuss the following:

- What role does the `static` keyword play in Java, and how can it be beneficial in developing game utilities or constants?
  
- Imagine a game scoreboard. How would using a `static` method help manage player scores efficiently? Include a hypothetical example.

**Expected Length:** 150-200 words per topic.

*Tip: Focus on scenarios where static elements offer efficiency, such as utility methods or universally accessible constants.*

## üíª Exercise 3: Player Movement using Arrays

**Objective:** Implement a basic player movement system using arrays.

**Task:**

1. Define a 2D array representing a simple game map (e.g., 5x5 grid). Initialize it with a player's starting position.
   
2. Create a method using an array to update the player's position based on input (e.g., move "up", "down", "left", "right").

**Example:**

```java
public static void movePlayer(char[][] map, String direction) {
    // Implement logic to change player position based on direction
}
```

**Deliverables:** The `movePlayer` method in a Java file.

*Ensure player movement is bounded by the array limits!*

## üéØ Exercise 4: Managing Enemies with ArrayLists

**Objective:** Use `ArrayLists` to manage dynamic game entities, such as enemies.

**Task:**

1. Create a class `Enemy` with fields for `position` and `health`.
   
2. Use an `ArrayList` to manage multiple enemy instances in your game. Implement a method to iterate over this list and update enemy positions randomly within the grid.

**Example:**

```java
ArrayList<Enemy> enemies = new ArrayList<>();
enemies.add(new Enemy(2, 2, 100));

public void updateEnemyPositions() {
    // Implement random movement logic for enemies
}
```

**Deliverables:** A Java file containing the `Enemy` class and the `updateEnemyPositions` method.

*Remember to use randomization in a way that respects the grid boundaries.*

## üèÜ Exercise 5: Build a Scoring System

**Objective:** Develop a simple scoring system using both `static` variables and loops.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Initialize the Score:** Create a `static` variable `score` in a new `Game` class.
   
2. **Implement Scoring Logic:** Develop methods that increase the score when certain events occur (e.g., defeating an enemy). Use loops to iterate over enemy positions to check for interactions.

```java
public static int score = 0;

public static void updateScoreForEnemyDefeat(int points) {
    score += points;
}
```

3. **Display the Score:** Add functionality to display the score inside your loop that manages game updates.

**Deliverables:** A Java file for the `Game` class showing score logic.

*Make the scoring system flexible to accommodate different challenges and victories.*

## üéÆ Exercise 6: Player vs. Enemy Interaction

**Objective:** Develop a complete interaction system between player and enemies using all concepts learned.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Implement Player Attack Mechanism:**
   - Create a method for the player to attack, reducing an enemy's health if they occupy adjacent positions.
   - Use loops and array/ArrayList operations to manage interactions.

```java
public void playerAttack(int playerX, int playerY) {
    // Check adjacent positions and affect enemies
}
```

2. **Develop Enemy Collision Responses:**
   - If an enemy collides with the player, reduce the player's health.
   - Introduce a simple health management using the static keyword for simplicity.

3. **Integrate Systems:**
   - Combine movement, scoring, and interaction into a seamless gameplay loop.
   - Ensure the game runs playfully, updating positions, checking interactions, and updating scores.

**Deliverables:** A comprehensive Java file integrating all systems into a functional gameplay experience.

*Consider edge cases like simultaneous player/enemy movements and enemy overlaps.*

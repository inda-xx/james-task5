# üéÆ Game Development Task: Building A Basic Game with Player and Enemy Interactions

Welcome to the exciting task of building a simple game application! This task is designed to help you solidify your understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, collections, and static methods in Java. You'll create a game featuring a player, enemies, and interactions, including a scoring system. By the end of this task, you'll have a functional game with basic mechanics and a vast improvement in managing data structures. Let's dive into the exercises!

## üìö Learning Goals

- Mastery of `Arrays` and `ArrayLists`
- Understanding and application of the `static` keyword
- Combining loops with collections for effective data management

## üß© Task Overview

You will progressively build a simple game application by completing the exercises below. Each exercise will focus on a different aspect of game development and programming concepts. You will conceptualize, plan, and code sections of the game in a gradual and structured manner.

## üè´ Exercise 1: Understanding Arrays

**Objective:** Gain a theoretical understanding of arrays and their use in game development.

**Instructions:**

1. **What is an Array?** Explain in your own words what an array is and how it can be used to store player positions in a game. Discuss its limitations and advantages over other data structures.

2. **Array vs. ArrayList:** Compare arrays and `ArrayList` in Java. When would you use one over the other in the context of a game application?

**Expected Outcomes:**

- A clear description of arrays and an understanding of their role in games.
- Insight into the choice between arrays and `ArrayList` for dynamic vs. static data structures.

## üè´ Exercise 2: The Static Keyword

**Objective:** Understand the role and utility of the `static` keyword in Java programs.

**Instructions:**

1. **Static Context:** Explain what the `static` keyword does in Java and how it can be relevant in game development, particularly for managing game states and constants.

2. **Benefits and Risks:** Discuss the benefits and potential risks of using static variables and methods. How can they simplify game logic, and what pitfalls should you be aware of?

**Expected Outcomes:**

- A solid understanding of how and why to use static features in a program.
- Awareness of best practices and common pitfalls in utilizing static attributes.

## üîß Exercise 3: Player Movement with Arrays

**Objective:** Implement a simple array-based system to track and update player positions.

**Instructions:**

1. **Setup an Array:** Initialize an array to represent the player‚Äôs position on a simple grid-based map, such as a 5x5 grid.

2. **Move the Player:** Write a method to update the player‚Äôs position within the grid when given directional input (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`). Ensure the player does not move out of bounds.

```java
public static void movePlayer(int[] position, String direction) {
    // Implement movement logic
}
```

**Expected Outcomes:**

- A functional method that modifies the player's position based on direction, maintaining grid boundaries.
- Practical application of array manipulation in a game context.

## üîß Exercise 4: Scoring System with ArrayLists

**Objective:** Develop a scoring system for your game using `ArrayLists`.

**Instructions:**

1. **Track Scores:** Create an `ArrayList` to store scores. Implement methods to add a score, calculate the average score, and find the highest score.

```java
public static void addScore(ArrayList<Integer> scores, int score) {
    // Add score to list
}

public static int calculateAverage(ArrayList<Integer> scores) {
    // Calculate average score
}

public static int findHighestScore(ArrayList<Integer> scores) {
    // Find highest score
}
```

2. **Display Scores:** Write a method to print all scores and their statistics.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- Success in building a flexible system that stores and analyzes game scores.
- Enhanced ability to work with `ArrayLists` and manipulate data effectively.

## üöÄ Exercise 5: Implementing Enemy Interactions

**Objective:** Create interactions between the player and enemies using loops and data structures.

**Instructions:**

1. **Enemy Positions:** Use an `ArrayList` to store multiple enemy positions on the grid.

2. **Detect Collisions:** Implement a method to check if the player's new position collides with any enemy position.

```java
public static boolean checkCollision(int[] playerPosition, ArrayList<int[]> enemyPositions) {
    // Implement collision detection
}
```

3. **Response to Collision:** Create a method to respond (e.g., reduce player health or reset position) when a collision is detected.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- Competence in checking conditions within loops and using data structures to handle game state.
- Ability to combine different data management techniques to achieve game objectives.

## üöÄ Exercise 6: Putting It All Together ‚Äì Create a Playable Game

**Objective:** Combine all elements to create a basic playable game.

**Instructions:**

1. **Integrate Components:** Use all previously coded methods and logic to build a game with player movement, scoring, and enemy interaction.

2. **Game Loop:** Implement a simple game loop that allows the player to move, avoid enemies, and collect scores until a win/lose condition is met.

```java
public static void runGame() {
    // Use a loop to run the game
}
```

3. **Player Feedback:** Write methods to provide feedback on game actions and display the score at the end of the game.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- Complete a functioning game with core mechanics, demonstrating significant programming effort and integration of learned concepts.
- Develop problem-solving skills and understanding of combining loops and collections in a real-world application.

# üéÆ Game Development Challenge: Simple Adventure Game

## Project Overview
In this project, you'll build a simple adventure game featuring basic player movement, a scoring system, and interactions with enemies. This task will develop your skills in handling arrays, understanding the `static` keyword, working with `ArrayLists`, and combining loops with collections. The game will simulate a simple grid world where the player navigates, collects points, and dodges enemies.

## Learning Goals
- Master the use of `Arrays` in managing game states.
- Understand and apply the `static` keyword for creating game constants and utility methods.
- Manipulate `ArrayLists` to handle dynamic game elements.
- Integrate loops and collections to control game logic and flow.

## Exercises

### üìù Exercise 1: Understanding Arrays in Game Development
**Objective:** Grasp the role of arrays as data structures in game development.

**Task:** Explain in detail how arrays can be used to manage the game grid's state, player position, and enemy locations. Consider the advantages and limitations of arrays for these purposes, and how they compare to other data structures like lists or sets in Java.

**Questions:**
1. How can a two-dimensional array represent a grid-based game world?
2. Discuss the trade-offs of using arrays for storing enemy positions versus an `ArrayList`.

### üìù Exercise 2: The Role of `static` in Game Applications
**Objective:** Understand the usage of the `static` keyword within a game application's context.

**Task:** Provide a detailed explanation of how the `static` keyword can be applied for defining game constants, utility methods, and any other shared resources in the game.

**Questions:**
1. What are the benefits of using `static` methods for utility functions (e.g., calculating distance between entities)?
2. Describe how `static` variables can manage game-wide constants, like maximum grid size or default player speed.

### üíª Exercise 3: Coding Player Movement with Arrays
**Objective:** Implement player movement using arrays to track their position on a grid.

**Instructions:**
- Initialize a 5x5 game grid using a two-dimensional array, with a starting position for the player.
- Write a method `movePlayer(int direction)` that updates the player's position based on an input direction (`0` for up, `1` for down, `2` for left, `3` for right).
- Ensure movements respect the grid's boundaries.

```java
int[][] grid = new int[5][5];
int playerX = 0, playerY = 0;

public static void movePlayer(int direction) {
    // Implement movement logic
}
```

### üíª Exercise 4: Implementing and Managing Dynamic Enemies
**Objective:** Use `ArrayLists` to manage dynamic enemy positions and integrate them with player interactions.

**Instructions:**
- Initialize an `ArrayList` to track multiple enemy positions as pairs of coordinates within the grid.
- Write a method `updateEnemies()` that iterates over the enemy `ArrayList` and randomly shifts their positions (on valid moves).
- If an enemy moves onto the player's position, deduct points from the player's score.

```java
ArrayList<int[]> enemies = new ArrayList<>();

public static void updateEnemies() {
    // Implement enemy movement logic
}
```

### üöÄ Exercise 5: Scoring System with Arrays and Loops
**Objective:** Develop a scoring mechanism to reward player achievements and integrate it with other game systems.

**Instructions:**
- Use an array to store point values associated with collecting items placed on the grid.
- Implement a method `collectItem()` that increases the player's score when moving over an item.
- Ensure the method updates the game grid and removes the collected item.

```java
int[] scores = new int[25]; // Assume 5x5 grid flat array representation

public static void collectItem(int x, int y) {
    // Implement scoring logic
}
```

### üöÄ Exercise 6: Designing Enemy Interaction
**Objective:** Enhance enemy interaction logic to create an engaging gameplay experience.

**Instructions:**
- Develop a method `playerInteractWithEnemies()` that checks for collisions between the player and enemies. If a collision occurs, implement a health reduction mechanic for the player.
- Utilize loops and collections to efficiently check interactions and update game state accordingly.

```java
int playerHealth = 100;

public static void playerInteractWithEnemies() {
    // Implement interaction logic
}
```

## Deliverables
- Source code files (`Game.java`, etc.) demonstrating the implementation of the above tasks.
- Comprehensive documentation explaining your design decisions and code functionality.
- Console-based test cases demonstrating your game application.

## Key Points
- Use arrays for static, grid-like structures in your game.
- Leverage `static` for constants and utility functions across the game.
- Apply `ArrayLists` for dynamic enemy management and player interactions.
- Use loops to seamlessly integrate the various game components, ensuring efficient and modular code.

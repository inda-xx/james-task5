# 🎮 Simple Game Application Development Task

Welcome to your exciting journey in developing a simple game application! This task will guide you through creating a game from scratch while focusing on important programming concepts such as arrays, the static keyword, ArrayLists, and combining loops with collections. Let's get started!

## 🚀 Task Overview

Your task is to develop a simple console-based game that includes:

- Player movement
- A scoring system
- Enemy interactions

You will break down the task through several exercises that progressively build your skills and understanding of the required concepts.

## Exercise 1: 📚 Understanding Arrays and ArrayLists

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
- Develop a solid conceptual understanding of arrays and ArrayLists in Java.

### 📝 Task Description:
Arrays and ArrayLists are fundamental data structures in Java. Answer the following questions to demonstrate your understanding:

1. **What are the key differences between arrays and ArrayLists in Java?**
   - Explain with examples when to use each.

2. **How do you create and initialize an array and an ArrayList in Java?**
   - Provide the syntax and explain the lifecycle of both from creation to garbage collection.

## Exercise 2: 📍 Exploring the 'static' Keyword

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
- Gain insight into the use of the `static` keyword and its implications in Java.

### 📝 Task Description:
The `static` keyword plays a crucial role in Java. Consider the following:

1. **Explain the concept of the `static` keyword in Java. What does it mean when a method or variable is declared static?**
   - Illustrate with examples.

2. **Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using static methods and variables.**
   - Provide scenarios where using static might be beneficial or detrimental.

## Exercise 3: 🕹️ Implementing Player Movement

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
- Utilize arrays and loops to handle basic player movement within a game.

### 📝 Task Description:
Create a simple grid-based movement system for your player using arrays:

1. **Define a 2D array representing the game grid (e.g., 5x5). Place your player at a starting position (say, [0][0]).**

   ```java
   char[][] grid = new char[5][5];
   grid[0][0] = 'P'; // 'P' represents the player.
   ```

2. **Implement a method to move the player up, down, left, or right based on user input while staying within bounds.**

   ```java
   public void movePlayer(String direction, char[][] grid) {
       // Implement movement logic
   }
   ```

## Exercise 4: 💰 Building a Scoring System

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
- Combine arrays, loops, and the static keyword to maintain a scoring system.

### 📝 Task Description:
Implement a scoring system that tracks points in an ArrayList:

1. **Create a static ArrayList to store scores. As the player moves and collects items, update the score.**

   ```java
   public static ArrayList<Integer> scores = new ArrayList<>();
   
   public static void collectItem() {
       // Add logic to increase score and add to ArrayList
   }
   ```

2. **Write a method to display the current score and the total score achieved so far.**

   ```java
   public static void displayScores() {
       // Implement display logic
   }
   ```

## Exercise 5: 👾 Implementing Enemy Interactions

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
- Use ArrayLists and loops to implement simple enemy interactions.

### 📝 Task Description:
Enhance your game by adding enemies that interact with the player:

1. **Initialize an ArrayList to store enemy positions. Implement logic to update enemy positions per round.**

   ```java
   ArrayList<int[]> enemies = new ArrayList<>();

   public void updateEnemyPositions() {
       // Move enemies randomly on each update
   }
   ```

2. **Write collision detection logic to check if the player collides with an enemy, ending the game.**

   ```java
   public boolean checkCollision(int playerX, int playerY, ArrayList<int[]> enemies) {
       // Implement collision detection logic
   }
   ```

## Exercise 6: 🔧 Integrating Features and Finalizing the Game

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
- Integrate all elements into a cohesive game, and polish the logic for a complete user experience.

### 📝 Task Description:
Bring together all components to finalize your game:

1. **Integrate player movement, scoring, and enemy interaction into a seamless game loop.**

   ```java
   public void gameLoop() {
       while (true) {
           // Call functions for player movement, score handling, enemy update, and collision check
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Implement end-game conditions, such as winning upon reaching a particular score or losing upon collision.**

   ```java
   public void checkEndGameConditions() {
       // Define conditions to end the game
   }
   ```

## 🎉 Conclusion

Congratulations! You've built a simple game application using arrays, static methods, ArrayLists, and loops. This task not only enhanced your understanding of Java collections and control structures but also your ability to integrate various programming concepts into a complete project.

Feel free to experiment further, add more features, or enhance the existing ones to make your game even more interesting. Remember, practice is key to mastering programming!

Happy coding! 👩‍💻👨‍💻

## 🎮 Game Development Task: Simple 2D Adventure Game

Welcome to the Game Development Task! In this series of exercises, you'll create a simple 2D adventure game. This task will guide you through creating key functionalities such as player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. By the end of this task, you'll have a basic game running and a deeper understanding of Java programming concepts, including arrays, the static keyword, and ArrayLists. 

### 🏹 Learning Objectives
- Master the use of arrays and ArrayLists.
- Understand static variables and methods.
- Manipulate collections with loops.
- Integrate game logic through progressive exercises.

### 🚩 Exercise 1: Understanding Arrays in Game Development

#### 🧠 Theory

Grasp the basic purpose and utilization of arrays in game development. Consider the following questions:

1. **Why are arrays critical for handling game data?**\
   Discuss the advantages of using arrays over individual variables for game elements such as player inventory or enemy positions.

2. **Explain static techniques for game data management.**\
   Consider scenarios where static methods or variables would be beneficial in game development. Why might these techniques streamline certain processes or logic in a game framework?

_Response._
Use detailed reasoning to address these questions, touching on performance implications and structural clarity in game logic.

### 🚩 Exercise 2: Conceptualizing ArrayLists in Dynamic Game Environments

Understanding the theory behind ArrayLists to manage dynamic game elements:

1. **ArrayList vs. Arrays:**\
   Compare and contrast ArrayLists with arrays in the context of game development, focusing on scenarios where dynamic sizing is crucial.

2. **Static vs. Instance Variables in Game Settings:**\
   When would you define variables or methods as static in a game setting, and what are the trade-offs?

_Theory._ Provide comprehensive explanations and examples where applicable, drawing from hypothetical game scenarios.

### 🚩 Exercise 3: Coding Player Movement with Arrays

#### 🎮 Coding

Implement player movement within a grid-based game world using arrays:

- Create a 2D `char` array representing the game grid.
- Implement a method to move the player character using W, A, S, D keys.

```java
public static void movePlayer(char[][] grid, String direction) {
    // Code to change the player's position within the grid based on direction input
}
```

_Example,_ provide test cases demonstrating player movement across the grid.

### 🚩 Exercise 4: Basic Scoring System with Static Methods

#### 🎮 Coding

Design a static method-based scoring system:

- Implement a static variable to hold the player's score.
- Method to increase and display the score.

```java
public class GameScore {
    private static int score = 0;

    public static void increaseScore(int points) {
        // Increment the player's score by the specified points
    }
    
    public static void displayScore() {
        // Print the current score to the console
    }
}
```

_Code._ Use this in a mock gameplay scenario, demonstrating score changes.

### 🚩 Exercise 5: Managing Enemies with ArrayLists

#### 🎯 Advanced Coding

Create a dynamic enemy system:

1. Use an `ArrayList<String>` to store enemy names or IDs.
2. Implement methods to add, remove, and list current enemies in the game world.

```java
public class EnemyManager {
    private ArrayList<String> enemies = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addEnemy(String name) {
        // Add an enemy
    }

    public void removeEnemy(String name) {
        // Remove an enemy
    }
    
    public List<String> listEnemies() {
        // Return a list of current enemies
    }
}
```

_Demonstrate_ with scenarios where enemies enter or leave the player’s proximity.

### 🚩 Exercise 6: Combining Functionality in a Complete Game Loop

#### 🕹️ Challenge

Integrate all components into a functional game loop:

1. Initialize the game grid and place the player.
2. Allow the player to move and update their position.
3. Modify the score based on player actions.
4. Simulate and react to enemy encounters through ArrayList management.
5. Include a game over condition based on specific criteria (e.g., score, or defeated enemies).

```java
public class GameLoop {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize grid, player, and enemies
        // Implement the game loop handling player input, scoring, and enemies
    }
}
```

_Challenge._ Ensure proper integration and seamless flow between different game components, providing a playable demo demonstrating all implemented functionalities.

**Good Luck!** May your code be bug-free and your game enjoyable! Test thoroughly and experiment with additional features or improvements once you've completed the core tasks.

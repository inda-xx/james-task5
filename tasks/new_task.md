# üéÆ Mini Game Application: Building Blocks of Java

Welcome to this exciting programming task where you'll create a simple game application. This task will help you hone your skills on arrays, ArrayLists, static keywords, and how to combine loops and collections effectively. By the end, you'll have a mini game with player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions!

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding and working with `Arrays` and `ArrayLists`
- The role of the `static` keyword in Java
- Combining loops with collections to solve practical problems

## üåü Task Overview

You'll create a simple game with a focus on player movement, scoring, and interactions with enemies. This task is broken down into multiple exercises that gradually increase in difficulty.

## üìö Exercise 1: Theoretical Foundations of Arrays and ArrayLists

**Goal:** Solidify your understanding of arrays and ArrayLists.

### Instructions:

1. **Conceptual Questions:**

   a. Describe how arrays and ArrayLists differ in terms of structure and usage.

   b. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using an ArrayList compared to an array in a Java program.

2. **Hands-On Analysis:**

   Consider a scenario where your game needs to track player positions and enemy positions. Explain which data structure (array or ArrayList) you would choose for:
   
   a. Tracking a fixed number of player positions.

   b. Tracking a dynamically changing number of enemy positions that can increase or decrease during gameplay.

*In your explanation, emphasize the scenarios with memory usage and flexibility.*

## üìö Exercise 2: Mastering the `static` Keyword

**Goal:** Gain a deeper understanding of the `static` keyword.

### Instructions:

1. **Conceptual Questions:**

   a. What is the `static` keyword used for in Java? Provide an example scenario in a game where `static` might be applicable.

   b. Discuss the implications of using `static` variables in a multiplayer game where multiple player instances exist.

2. **Scenario Analysis:**

   Imagine a global leaderboard feature that keeps track of the highest scores achieved in the game. Discuss how `static` variables or methods can be utilized to implement this feature effectively. What are the potential pitfalls?

*Explain your reasoning with examples, highlighting the role of `static` in managing shared data.*

## üíª Exercise 3: Implementing Player Movement with Arrays

**Goal:** Apply your array knowledge to implement player movement.

### Task:

Implement a simple 2D player movement system using a grid represented by a 2D array.

1. Create a `Game` class with a `static` field for a 2D array representing the game grid. The grid should be initialized to represent a 5x5 play area.

2. Implement a method `public static void movePlayer(int direction)` that takes an integer representing direction (e.g., 0: up, 1: down, 2: left, 3: right) and updates the player's position in the grid.

3. Initialize the player's starting position and ensure that movement updates the grid correctly.

4. Prevent the player from moving out of the grid bounds.

*Test your implementation by creating a player movement scenario and print the grid after each move.*

## üíª Exercise 4: Building a Scoring System and Enemy Interactions with ArrayLists

**Goal:** Use ArrayLists and loops to manage a scoring system and enemy interactions.

### Task:

1. Add an `ArrayList<Integer>` to the `Game` class to represent enemy positions (e.g., one-dimensional for simplicity).

2. Implement a method `public static void interactWithEnemies()` that checks for interactions between the player and enemies:
   - If the player encounters an enemy, increase the score.
   - Remove the enemy from the list after the interaction.
   - Print the updated score.

3. Implement a method `public static void addEnemy(int position)` to add new enemies to the list, simulating enemy appearances during gameplay.

4. Demonstrate the complete enemy interaction system:
   - Add some enemies.
   - Move the player through the grid.
   - Encounter enemies and update scores accordingly.

*Ensure the console outputs reflect the changes in player position, enemy positions, and score.*

## üìú Conclusion and Submission

Congratulations on completing the mini project! You've effectively integrated arrays, ArrayLists, loops, and the static keyword to create a functional component of a simple game. Ensure your code is well-documented and submit your solution according to your instructor's guidelines.

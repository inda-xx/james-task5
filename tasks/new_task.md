### üéÆ Build Your Own Arcade Game: Dodging Frenzy! 

Welcome to a thrilling programming task where you'll create a simple arcade-style game. The goal is to guide a player character, collect points by interacting with a scoring system, and dodge enemies using strategic movements! Through this task, you'll gain practical experience in using arrays, understanding the `static` keyword, and working with `ArrayLists`. Let's embark on this adventure with a structured approach, starting from theory and gradually moving to complex coding tasks.

### üèÅ Exercise 1: Theory Behind Arrays
**Objective**: Deepen your understanding of arrays as a data structure.

- **Task**: Answer the following questions:
  1. What are arrays in Java, and how do they differ from `ArrayLists`?
  2. Discuss two scenarios where arrays are preferable over `ArrayLists` and vice versa.
  
- **Tips**: Use examples to illustrate the differences and advantages of each structure.

### üß† Exercise 2: Static Keyword Demystified
**Objective**: Comprehend the role and scope of the `static` keyword in Java.

- **Task**: Explain the meaning of the `static` keyword in Java. Discuss:
  1. How static variables and methods behave differently from instance variables and methods.
  2. Provide a real-world analogy to describe the concept of static in programming.

- **Outcome**: Gain a conceptual clarity that will help you design static components in your game engine.

### üóÉÔ∏è Exercise 3: Setting Up the Game Environment
**Objective**: Initialize the game space using arrays and `static` variables.

- **Instructions**:
  1. Create a class `GameEnvironment` with a 2D grid (array) representing the game board.
  2. Use static variables to define board dimensions and initial player starting position (`START_POSITION`).

- **Example**:
    ```java
    public class GameEnvironment {
        private static final int BOARD_WIDTH = 10;
        private static final int BOARD_HEIGHT = 10;
        private int[][] board = new int[BOARD_WIDTH][BOARD_HEIGHT];
        private static final int START_POSITION = 0;

        // Game setup
        public void initialize() {
            board[0][0] = START_POSITION; // Start player here
        }
    }
    ```
- **Goal**: Provide a structured foundation that future exercises will build upon.

### üéØ Exercise 4: Implementing Simple Player Movement
**Objective**: Enable player movement within the game board.

- **Instructions**:
  1. Add a method `movePlayer` to move the player position using given directions (up, down, left, right) stored in an array.
  2. Handle boundary conditions to prevent the player from moving off the board.

- **Example**:
    ```java
    public void movePlayer(String direction) {
        // Logic to update player position
    }
    ```

- **Outcome**: Practice manipulating arrays and reinforcing static board attributes to handle movement logic.

### üöÄ Exercise 5: Dynamic Scoring System
**Objective**: Introduce dynamic scoring using `ArrayLists`.

- **Instructions**:
  1. Use `ArrayList<Integer>` to store points collected during the game.
  2. Create a method `addScore` that adds points when a certain goal is achieved on the board.

- **Example**:
    ```java
    ArrayList<Integer> scores = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addScore(int points) {
        scores.add(points);
    }
    ```

- **Challenge**: Ensure scores are correctly managed, and display the total score.

### üëæ Exercise 6: Engaging Enemy Interactions
**Objective**: Implement enemies and manage interactions using loops and collections.

- **Instructions**:
  1. Create an `Enemy` class with positions stored in an `ArrayList`.
  2. Add a method `moveEnemies` to randomly update enemy positions on the board.
  3. Check collisions between player and enemies, effectively halting the game if they intersect.

- **Example**:
    ```java
    ArrayList<int[]> enemyPositions = new ArrayList<>();

    public void moveEnemies() {
        // Logic to randomly move enemies and update their positions
    }

    public boolean checkCollision() {
        // Logic to check if player collides with any enemy
    }
    ```

- **Goal**: Combine loops and collections for dynamic game interactions, creating challenging scenarios.

### üåü Wrap-Up
Congratulations on embarking on this adventure! Through these exercises, you successfully created a simple but comprehensive game engine that covers critical programming concepts. By integrating arrays, the static keyword, `ArrayLists`, and loops, you've built a robust and interactive arcade game framework. Happy coding! üéÆ

### 🎮 Simple Game Application Task

Welcome to a fun and challenging task where you will create a simple game application! This journey will help you explore key concepts in programming and apply them to build an interactive console-based game. 

The game will involve:
- Player movement on a grid
- A scoring system
- Enemy interactions

By completing this task, you'll strengthen your understanding of arrays, the `static` keyword, `ArrayLists`, and combining loops with collections. Let's dive into it!

### 🧠 Exercise 1: Theoretical Exploration of Arrays

In this exercise, you will explore the concept and structure of arrays without writing any code, just ideas:

1. **Question:** Explain how arrays are used in programming to handle multiple data elements of the same type. How do they differ from other data structures like lists in terms of memory allocation?

2. **Task:** Draw a diagram to visually represent an integer array of size 5 on a grid. Indicate indices and example values.

3. **Explanation:** Discuss the computational benefits and limitations of using arrays for managing game entities like players, enemies, or item positions.

### 📚 Exercise 2: Understanding the Static Keyword

Get to grips with the `static` keyword to understand its role in Java programming:

1. **Question:** What does the `static` keyword do in Java, and how does it affect memory allocation and the scope of methods or variables?

2. **Scenario:** Explain how you would use a `static` variable to keep track of the game's high score across multiple game sessions. What risks and benefits do you foresee?

3. **Discussion:** Provide a brief discussion on the pros and cons of using `static` methods when designing game logic and utility functions.

### 🛠️ Exercise 3: Player Movement with Arrays and ArrayLists

It's time to start coding! Let's manage your player's position using arrays and collections:

1. **Task:** Create a Java class named `GameGrid` that initializes a 10x10 grid using a 2D array. Implement a method `movePlayer(int x, int y)` to update the player's position on the grid. The player's current position should be represented by the number 1, and all other positions should be 0.

2. **Implementation:** Use an `ArrayList` to maintain a history of player's movements. Implement a function `printMoveHistory()` to print all past coordinates.

Example usage:
```java
GameGrid game = new GameGrid();
game.movePlayer(2, 3);
game.movePlayer(4, 5);
game.printMoveHistory(); // Outputs: (2, 3), (4, 5)
```

### 🏆 Exercise 4: Scoring System and Statics

Enhance the game with a scoring system using static fields and methods:

1. **Task:** Add a `static` variable `highScore` in your `GameUtility` class to track the highest score achieved. Implement static methods to `getHighScore()` and `updateHighScore(int newScore)`.

2. **Implementation:** In `GameGrid`, implement a scoring method `increaseScore()`, which increases the score by 10 each time the player moves to a specific "bonus" grid cell.

```java
public class GameUtility {
    private static int highScore = 0;

    public static void updateHighScore(int score) {
        if (score > highScore) highScore = score;
    }

    public static int getHighScore() {
        return highScore;
    }
}
```

### 🚀 Exercise 5: Enemy Interaction and Collection Manipulation

Make your game more thrilling by adding enemies!

1. **Task:** Modify `GameGrid` to include enemies at random positions within the grid, using an `ArrayList` to keep track. Represent enemies with the number 2 in the grid.

2. **Challenge:** Implement a method `checkCollisions()` that checks if the player has moved onto a position occupied by an enemy. If so, print "Game Over!" and reset the player’s position.

3. **Code Snippet:** Here's how the setup might look:

```java
public void checkCollisions() {
    // Logic to check player position against enemies' positions
    if (grid[playerX][playerY] == 2) {
        System.out.println("Game Over!");
        // Reset code...
    }
}
```

### 🌟 Exercise 6: Integrating Loops and Collections for Gameplay

Now, combine your learnings to create a loop-driven game flow:

1. **Implementation:** Create a `startGame()` method that uses a loop to repeatedly prompt the player for movement commands (e.g., "up", "down", "left", "right") to control their character across the grid. Exit the loop if "Game Over!" is triggered or a termination command is issued (e.g., "quit").

2. **Enhancement:** Introduce a command "show score" to fetch and print the current score and high score. Use static methods effectively to retrieve high scores.

3. **Example Main Loop:**
```java
public void startGame() {
    while (true) {
        // Read command
        // Perform actions based on command
        // Check for collisions
        // Update and display scores
        // Break loop on "quit"
    }
}
```

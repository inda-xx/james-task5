### üïπÔ∏è Simple Game Application: Understanding Player Movement, Scoring System, and Enemy Interactions

In this task, you will create a simple game application with essential game functionalities: player movement, a scoring system, and interactions with enemies. This task will guide you through exercises that gradually increase in complexity, helping you gain practical programming skills through the integration of various concepts like arrays, `static` keyword, ArrayLists, and loops. 

**Learning Goals:**
- Mastering the use of `Arrays`.
- Grasping the `static` keyword.
- Skillfully using `ArrayLists`.
- Combining loops and collections for efficient coding.

### üìö Theoretical Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Understanding Arrays and Their Use in Games
**Task:** Write a detailed explanation of how arrays can be used to manage a grid-based game world, like a simple maze or board game.
- **Points to Consider:**
  - How two-dimensional arrays can represent a grid.
  - How arrays store player and enemy positions.
  - Examples where arrays are effective in games.

#### Exercise 2: The Role of the Static Keyword
**Task:** Explain the importance of the `static` keyword in the context of game state management.
- **Points to Consider:**
  - How `static` is used for shared game properties (e.g., score).
  - The impact of `static` on memory and performance.
  - Risks of overusing `static` in game development.

### üíª Practical Coding Exercises

#### Exercise 3: Building the Game Framework with Arrays
**Task:** Implement a basic grid-based game world using a two-dimensional array.
- **Requirements:**
  - Create a `class GameWorld` with a `static` array to represent the grid.
  - Add methods to initialize the grid and place the player at a starting point.

```java
public class GameWorld {
    private static final int[][] grid = new int[10][10]; // A 10x10 grid

    public static void initializeGrid() {
        // Initialize grid with default values, e.g., 0 for empty spaces
    }
    
    public static void placePlayer(int x, int y) {
        // Place the player at specified coordinates in the grid
    }
}
```

#### Exercise 4: Managing Dynamic Game Elements with ArrayLists
**Task:** Use `ArrayLists` to dynamically manage enemies in the game.
- **Requirements:**
  - Create an `ArrayList` to store enemy positions.
  - Add methods to add and remove enemies dynamically.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class GameWorld {
    private static ArrayList<int[]> enemies = new ArrayList<>();

    public static void addEnemy(int x, int y) {
        // Add new enemy coordinates to the list
    }

    public static void removeEnemy(int index) {
        // Remove enemy based on index
    }
}
```

### üöÄ Advanced Coding Challenges

#### Exercise 5: Implementing Player Movement
**Step 1:** Create methods in `GameWorld` for moving the player based on input.
- **Requirements:**
  - Implement movement handling using a simple input-based method.
  - Ensure the player doesn't move out of bounds.

```java
public static boolean movePlayer(String direction) {
    // Move player up, down, left, or right
    // Return false if movement is out of bounds, true otherwise
}
```

**Step 2:** Add functionality to detect and respond to collisions with enemies.

#### Exercise 6: Scoring System and Game Logic
**Task:** Integrate a scoring system that updates based on player actions.
- **Requirements:**
  - Use `static` variables to maintain the score.
  - Implement scoring rules (e.g., increase score by defeating an enemy).
  - Display score updates in the console.

```java
public class GameWorld {
    private static int score = 0;

    public static void updateScore(int points) {
        score += points;
        System.out.println("Current Score: " + score);
    }
}
```

**Integration:** Combine all previous components into a cohesive game loop, allowing user inputs to control the player and update the game state effectively.
